## API Integration

The application is designed to work with the following API endpoints:

```

### Image Search
```
POST /api/search/image
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: { image: File }
```

### Mock Data
For demonstration purposes, the app includes mock data generation when the API is not available. This allows you to test all functionality without a backend.
